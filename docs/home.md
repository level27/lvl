<p>Welcome, </p>

All the functionality within the cli is based on our already existing controlpanel "CP4".
Although you can find most of the functionality<br/> to manage your hosting already in CP4. There are some benefits to use out cli.

Although the cli focusses on getting used by more technical people, it can be used by anyone<br/>
 who has an account at Level27 CP4.
The main reason you might prefer our cli is that it is ofcourse<br/> a lot faster and much more efficient once you know the commands and how it works.
